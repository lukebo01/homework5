Create a mediated schema with minimum 20 attributes. Return the mediated schema in this format: 
a json file where for every column of the mediated schema is associated to a list where this list contains the attributes of the original tables.
The list is a list of string where each element has this format: 'table_name.column_name',
so the key should be like this: 'mediated_column_1': ['table_name_x.column_name_1', ...].
Be aware that some columns from the original tables may be split to better represent the domain, 
and vice versa. Make sure to use all the attributes of the tables in input.
Also return how the attributes of the input tables can separated/merged
